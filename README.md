## The Odin Project - Ruby Project: Knight Travails

Build a function knight_moves that shows the shortest possible way for a 
knight chess piece to get from one square to another on an 8x8 chess board 
by outputting all  squares the knight will stop on along the way

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Ruby
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github

## What I learned:
 - Better understanding of data structures, OOP
 - Specifically, binary search trees and breadth level search
 
## Still can improve:
 - I needed some help with the logic on the make tree method on this one
